#### Day2: OOP vs. DOP: Which One to Choose?
[7:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/live/qg6tj8Tf36E?t=25788s) – OOP vs. DOP: Which One to Choose? by Venkat Subramaniam </br>
DOP - Data oriented programing
* Four pillars of OOP (7:11:00)
  * Abstration (a way to deal with complexity)
  * Incapsulation (a way to separate what we do from how we do it)
  * Inheritance (a weakest pillar of OOP? Languages like Python, Javascript, Ruby don't rely on Inheritance)
  * Polymorphism (seems to be the fost important pillar)
* Polymorphism is essence of OOP (7:11:00)
* Factory and visitor patterns? (7:26:00)
  * We often find that when a language is more power, **we tend to use less patterns**
  * Why? Because **patterns become natural features of languages**
  * Some time patterns can bring *accidental complexity* and may violate [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself#:~:text=%22Don't%20repeat%20yourself%22,redundancy%20in%20the%20first%20place.) principal (like in the discussed example)
  * Overal this becoms very highly complex and clamsu code
  * Design and atchitecture is full of trade offs
 * Violation [open-closed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%E2%80%93closed_principle) proncipal (7:41:40)
