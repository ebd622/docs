#### Day2: OOP vs. DOP: Which One to Choose?
[7:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/live/qg6tj8Tf36E?t=25788s) – OOP vs. DOP: Which One to Choose? by Venkat Subramaniam </br>
DOP - Data oriented programing
* Four pillars of OOP (7:11:00)
  * Abstration (a way to deal with complexity)
  * Incapsulation (a way to separate what we do from how we do it)
  * Inheritance (a weakest pillar of OOP? Languages like Python, Javascript, Ruby don't rely on Inheritance)
  * Polymorphism (seems to be the fost important pillar)
* Polymorphism is essence of OOP (7:11:00)
* Factory and visitor patterns? (7:26:00)
