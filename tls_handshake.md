# TLS Handshake
### Summary
TLS Handshake creates a "protected tunnel" between Client and Server, it protects Bulk Data transfer with CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability)


TLS 1.2 uses RSA for Key Exchage, in TLS 1.3 RSA has been removed. TLS 1.3 uses more advanced approach called Diffieâ€“Hellman key exchange. Handshake in TLS 1.3 is faster.
