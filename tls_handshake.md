# TLS Handshake
### Summary
TLS Handshake creates a "protected tunnel" between Client and Server, it protects Bulk Data transfer with CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability)

TLS 1.2 uses RSA for Key Exchage, in TLS 1.3 RSA has been removed. TLS 1.3 uses more advanced approach called [Diffieâ€“Hellman key exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange). Handshake in TLS 1.3 is faster.

1. Client Hello
   Client sends the following data
   * Ver. - Highest TLS version that client supports
   * Rand# - Random number (32 bytes/256 bit). Timestamp encoded in first four bytes
   * Session ID
   * Cipher Suites
   * Extensions

3. Server Hello
4. Key exchange, cipher spec. Finished
5. Change cipher spec. Finished
6. HTTP Request
7. HTTP Response
