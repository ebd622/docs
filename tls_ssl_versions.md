# TLS/SSL versions

* TLS - Transport Layer Security
* SSL - Secure Socket Layer
* Terms TLS and SSL are mostly interchangeable

#### SSL 1.0
- Developed by Netscape
- Never publicly released
- Full of flaws
#### SSL 2.0
- Developed by Netscape
- Complete redesign of SSL 1.0 (to fix all flaws)
- Anyway, if was still full of flaws
#### SSL 3.0
- Complete redesign of SSL 2.0 by Netscape
- It is a foundation of TLS versions currently used
- New features:
  - Introduced concept of Certificate Chain
  - Added compression capability (vulnerability has been found there later, so compression was not really used)
  - Optional support for additional Key Exchange (SSL1.0 and SSL2.0 only supported RSA Key Exchange)
- Netscape relased it the word, a historical copy of it is available as RFC 6101
