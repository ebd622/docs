# Symmetric and Asymmetric Encryption
* **Symmetric encryption** uses a unique key that must be shared between parties (people or software) who need to receive messages.

Common Symmetric encryption algorithms:
* AES
* TwoFish
* BlowFish
* 3DEC 

* **Asymmetric encryption** uses a pair of public keys and a private key to encrypt and decrypt messages when they are communicated.
