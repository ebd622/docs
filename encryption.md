# Symmetric and Asymmetric Encryption
* **Symmetric encryption** uses a unique key that must be shared between parties (people or software) who need to receive messages.
  Common Symmetric encryption algorithms:
  * AES - one of the most frequently used algorithms. It is fast, ideal when handling large amounts of encrypted data.
  * TwoFish
  * BlowFish
  * 3DEC 

* **Asymmetric encryption** uses a pair of public keys and a private key to encrypt and decrypt messages when they are communicated.
